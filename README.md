# TA-Code-Reviewer
## Summmary
Small program that will extract all files from a zip file, and use [JPlag](https://github.com/jplag/jplag) to compare them automatically.

## Usage

First open the program and you will be prompted with a blank screen to select your zip file.

Navigate to the zip file, ensure that the name of the zip file is 3 unique words, seperated by '-'s.  In my case, my zip files are setup as <Course Code>-<Assignment Name>-<ID for website link on CMS>.

Once you select the file, the program will begin comparing the files, extracting all source code files from the zip file, and appending the students names to each file for comparison reasons into a folder alongside the original zip.

Another folder that contains the results will also be produced, go into the folder and open the index.html file.
